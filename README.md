# Very Fun JS Quiz
In this challange we were tasked with making a timed Javascript quiz app to test our knowledge of the material we were tought in the past week.
When the user clicks start they are given a question. When they get a question correct they notified by having the box they clicked turn green
When the user gets the question wrong they are notified by having the text boxes turn red and time will be subtracted from the timer.

## Challenges
In this assingment I struggled figuring out how to implement a timer to function properly. I had the right idea but deleted my Javascript file on accident and had to restart completely. I do feel as though my understanding of Basic Javascript concepts (DOM, objects, arrays etc) is improving. I would like to spend more time to complete all of the acceptance criteria, and clean up the messy code.
